> Overall the project looks great. I noticed just a few things. You appear to be missing the warnings for when the value of the bill or number of people is 0 or less. Also I noticed you have not replaced the icon on the browser tab. Your reset button works great and the custom input works as it should. Good job with responsiveness!
